## How to update Gitea for ADM ?

When an update is available you can do it directly from APP CENTRAL in ADM. If you want to do it manually, nothing could be easier. Uninstall Gitea and install the new version all your data will be kept, in some cases for major release it is possible that I indicate an additional procedure to follow.
