[INFORMATION]
This application requires a valid domain name and SSL certificate. Indeed, a Git code manager requires these fundamental elements to work properly and securely.

[ADMIN PANEL]
You can access the admin panel through : "https://your-domain-name:3100".


[SETUP]
(+) Database
You have two valid choices : don't touch anything and use an embedded database (SQLite3) or use (MySQL) and the ADM database. Be careful, to use the ADM database you must activate the MariaDB remote access and use the server ip address.

(+) General configuration
Indicate the title of the site, by default "Gitea : Git with a cup of tea", replace "localhost" by your domain name everywhere in the configuration. Be careful for the "Gitea base URL" parameter replace "https://localhost:3000/" by "https://your-domain:3100/" (use port 3100 for the base URL). leave the other port parameters on 22 and 3000.

(+) Email settings
It is advisable to use an SMTP server to secure Gitea and keep your development teams informed. Indicate the port of your SMTP server in the hostname configuration e.g. "smtp.endmove.eu:587".
