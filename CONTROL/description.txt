(+) General configuration
Indicate the title of the site, by default "Gitea : Git with a cup of tea", replace "localhost" by your domain name everywhere in the configuration. Be careful for the "Gitea base URL" parameter replace "https://localhost:3000/" by "https://your-domain:3100/" (use port 3100 for the base URL). leave the other port parameters on 22 and 3000.

(+) Email settings
It is advisable to use an SMTP server to secure Gitea and keep your development teams informed. Indicate the port of your SMTP server in the hostname configuration e.g. "smtp.endmove.eu:587".
